# The repository for the Spark training setup

This is the repository containing the starting project for the live Spark training in Python.

Recommended installation:

- [PyCharm](https://jetbrains.com/pycharm)

We're going to work with Python 3.7 and Spark 3.2 in the course. Feel free to set them up in the package manager of PyCharm (or your preferred Python IDE).
